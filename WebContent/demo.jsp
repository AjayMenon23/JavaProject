<b>Corporate Social Responsibility</b>
For Federal Bank, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been an inherited and 
inbuilt element of its culture from the day the bank was founded. Our Founder's 
values and ethos based on trust got embedded in the bank's policies and principles
which reflect on its day to day business. CSR in Federal Bank began with the first
act of cultivating banking habits  in an agrarian society - to effectively utilize
idle money for productive purposes.

Creating employment opportunity for a predominantly farming community was phase two.
The Bank is a commercial entity. It has to carry out its operations to generate 
profits to fulfill its responsibility to all stakeholders. But its activities are
carried out in the society and it owes to the society for its business  prosperity.
While carrying out its activities.Bank has approved a policy
for Sustainable Development, which ensures that Bank's activities are conducive 
to sustainable social welfare. In addition to this, Bank has to directly participate
in social activities to help the development of specific areas/segments
